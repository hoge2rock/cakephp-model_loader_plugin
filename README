How to use this plugin:

1. Move model_loader directory into app/plugins directory.

2. Add actsAs property like below to AppModel or any Model class in which you want to use this feature.
	var $actsAs = array('ModelLoader.ModelLoader');

3. Now you can load model from any method inside Model class like this.
	$this->loadModel('Hoge');
	$this->Hoge->find('list');

	No matter how many times you call loadModel(), target model is instantiated only once.
	For subsequent call, loadModel() returns the referrence of the same instance.
	So you don't need to mind about the performance so seriously.
	Feel free to call this method as much as you like.
